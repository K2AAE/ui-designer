==================

Create your angular bootstrap ui by drag and drop elements.

This 100% angular base application can be used to create a user interface by drag and drop elements to the canvas. The jQuery ui library is used to make elements dragable and dropable. By clicking the elements you can make select them. This unique meganisme allows the user to select elements on different levels when they are stacked on each other.

An implementation of the library can be found on http://willemveelenturf.nl/angular-ui-designer/

The work is still in progress but pleas feel free to help and make this library better.
